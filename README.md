# Deutilize

> You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means — Inigo Montoya, The Princess Bride

I see this word everywhere. It's a plague. I don't know what's going through the minds of people who ~~utilize~~ use it. I can't [make the world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXuFrtmOYKg), but I *can* hide the problem.

## Known issues

* Deutilize only runs on document load. That means modern web-apps which load content after the page loads don't get fixed. Perhaps a "redeutilize" feature could be added.

## Contributing

I modified the *excellent* [Cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension by Steven Frank. He released that under the "Do what the fuck you want to" license, so I'm doing the same, even if it has a rude swear in it.

So fix it, modify it, send me pull requests… do whatever you want.

## FAQ

### But Matt, you mad arse, utilize is a proper word

Yes I know. But that's not how it's used by (seemingly) most people. And the few times it *is* used correctly… actually "use" works pretty well there too.

### Why are you being so pendantic?

I don't take this as seriously as you might be assuming.
